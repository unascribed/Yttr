# Yttr

Yttr is a Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.16.5. It also works on 1.16.4 and probably 1.16.3.

Yttr has no specific focus; it's a collection of things I wanted or thought would be useful. That
may sound familiar if you've seen [Fabrication](https://unascribed.com/fabrication/), but unlike
Fabrication, Yttr is a "normal" content mod needed on both the client and server.

It draws a lot of inspiration from my favorite mods in the 1.4 - 1.6 era.

## FAQ

### **Q: Forge port?**
<span class="big">**A:** ***No.***</span> My other mods support Forge because it's a trivial effort on my part thanks to Forgery,
which automates 90% of the process. A mod like Yttr cannot be ported by Forgery due to the major
differences in adding new content between Forge and Fabric, and I am *not* interested in the work
required to maintain a Forge port. You've already got so much tech content on Forge, anyway.

### **Q: But whyyyyyyyyy?????**
<span class="big">**A:** Quite simply, I don't have fun developing for Forge.</span> Fabric is a
much easier platform for me personally to develop for, and it isn't actively hostile to its
developers just because they're using parts of the API the main dev doesn't like. I also greatly
prefer Yarn mappings to MCP or official Mojang mappings. <small>(Not to say there's nothing wrong
with Fabric. There's plenty wrong. Pick your poison, etc...)</small> I do this as a hobby, for *my
own* enjoyment. It's cool other people like it, but *if it's not fun, why bother*?

### **Q: Why Yttrium?**
<span class="big">**A:** I don't remember.</span> I originally used Yttrium for my first public 1.7 content mod, known as
[Farrago](https://github.com/unascribed-archive/Farrago), which is also the origin of the Yttric
Rifle. A later 1.7 content mod of mine, [Lanthanoid](https://github.com/unascribed-archive/Lanthanoid),
took things further and added a *ton* of lanthanide-family metals to go along with Yttrium. Yttr is
kind of an attempt to return to my roots, so I've chosen to draw more inspiration from Farrago. Back
then I probably just thought Yttrium was a cool metal with a hard-to-say name that no other mods had
used yet.

### **Q: So, how is Yttrium pronounced? How about Yttr?**
<span class="big">**A:** It-reum and It-er</span>, just as the real-world metal. I don't really
care how you say it, though. Lean really hard on that Y if you want. Why-tree-um.
