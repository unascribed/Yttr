# Yttr
*Voidtech and other goodies*

**The GitHub repository for Yttr is now a [mirror of the Gitea repository](https://git.sleeping.town/unascribed/Yttr).** GitHub-side issues will still be responded to.

A mod about the Void, what has gone before, and where you'll go from here.

A bit of a hodgepodge of random stuff I thought would be cool. It spiralled out of control, and is
now a fairly large content mod with complex lore.

A (successful) attempt at returning to my roots. Don't sweat the details, just have fun making fun.

[Check out the wiki](https://unascribed.com/yttr), [come chat on Discord](https://discord.gg/8WBauq2eYK),
or download it on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yttr) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/yttr).
Builds are also available on [Gitea](https://git.sleeping.town/unascribed/Yttr/releases) and [GitHub](https://github.com/unascribed/Yttr/releases),
including dev builds Curse and Modrinth don't get.
